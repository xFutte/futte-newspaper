# Newspaper script for QBCore

This newspaper resource will add a newspaper functionality to your beautiful QBCore FiveM server.

This resource supports:

- Buying a newspaper at a newspaper stand
- Viewing news
- Writing, updating & deleting news as a news reporter
- Previewing a story before publishing it
- Display of prison sentences when someone gets sent to jail
- Easy configuration

I'll offer support in **[my Discord server](https://discord.gg/R7MMSsZJ8r)**.

## Dependencies
- qb-target
- qb-inventory
- oxmysql

## Implementation
1. Run the attached import.sql file in the database.
2. Add the following to the `police:server:JailPlayer` event 
```lua
local name = OtherPlayer.PlayerData.charinfo.firstname.." "..OtherPlayer.PlayerData.charinfo.lastname
exports['futte-newspaper']:CreateJailStory(name, time)
```
after the line
```lua
if not Player or not OtherPlayer or Player.PlayerData.job.name ~= "police" then return end
```
3. Add the newspaper.png image into your qb-inventory folder, where all the other images are located (located in the root of the repo).
4. Add following to either your shared.lua or items.lua file based on what version of qb-core you have installed:
```lua
['newspaper'] = {['name'] = 'newspaper', ['label'] = 'Newspaper', ['weight'] = 10, ['type'] = 'item', ['image'] = 'newspaper.png', ['unique'] = false , ['useable'] = true, ['shouldClose'] = true, ['combinable'] = nil, ['description'] = 'Los Santos Newspaper'},
```
:bulb: Initially there will be a "Welcome.." story. As soon as you add your first story the "Welcome.." story will delete itself.

## Development

1. Navigate to ./web in a command prompt and run `npm install` to install all dependencies. If you don't already have node.js installed, you can [download it here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).'
2. Run `npm run dev` in ./web to compile the GUI.

:bulb: When you are done working with the resource run `npm run build` to minify and uglify the resource to decrease the resource size.

## Configuration

There are quite a lot of configurations possible out-of-the-box. These consists of two files: `config.js` and `config.lua`.
