# Newspaper script for QBCore

This standalone resource will add a newspaper functionality to your beautiful QBCore FiveM server and is still in active development.

This resource supports:

- Buying a newspaper at a newspaper stand
- Viewing news
- Writing, updating & deleting news as a news reporter
- Previewing a story before publishing it
- Display of prison sentences when someone gets sent to jail

The resource supports a lot of customization. See everything in the [configuration section](https://github.com/xFutte/qb-newspaper/blob/master/README.md#configuration).

## Preview

## Dependencies
- qb-target
- qb-inventory
- oxmysql

## Implementation
1. Run the attached import.sql file in the database
2. Add `exports['futte-newspaper']:CreateJailStory(name, time)` inside the `police:server:JailPlayer` event, parsing the name of the prisoner and the time sentenced as parameters.
3. Add the newspaper.png image into your qb-inventory folder, where all the other images are located (located in the root of the repo).
4. Add following to your shared.lua file:
```lua
['newspaper'] = {['name'] = 'newspaper', ['label'] = 'Newspaper', ['weight'] = 10, ['type'] = 'item', ['image'] = 'newspaper.png', ['unique'] = false , ['useable'] = true, ['shouldClose'] = true, ['combinable'] = nil, ['description'] = 'Los Santos Newspaper'},
```

## Development

1. Navigate to ./web and run `npm install` to install all dependencies. If you don't already have node.js you can [download it here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).'
2. Run `npm run dev` in ./web to compile the GUI.

:bulb: When you are done working with the resource run `npm run build` to minify and uglify the resource to decrease the resource size.

## Configuration
